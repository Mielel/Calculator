This project is about making a calculator with string as the base of the input.
However, it is limited to only being able to accept a string without space(s) as the input, which means it is unable receive the input such as "12 + 3 - 5". 

An example of supposed input is "12+5*7-9*78"
If the input starts with an operator (Ex: "+3-4*5", ends with an operator (Ex: "12+3+"), or there exists two or more operators in a consequent order (Ex: "12++5-6"), the program will ask the user to input the string again until the input meets the requirements.
