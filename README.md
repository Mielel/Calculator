This project is about making a calculator with string as the base of the input.

However, it is limited to only being able to accept a string without space(s) as the input, which means it is unable to receive input such as `12 + 3 - 5`.

An example of a valid input is `12+5*7-9*78`.

If the input starts with an operator (e.g., `+3-4*5`), ends with an operator (e.g., `12+3+`), or if there exist two or more operators in a row (e.g., `12++5-6`), the program will ask the user to input the string again until the input meets the requirements.
